## Symph Development Environment

This book is _actually a fork from the original guide_ by [Sourabh Bajaj](http://sourabhbajaj.com/) (A million thanks to him!) and is modifed heavily to fit the needs of a modern day Symph UI/UX Designer & Frontend Developers.

New to [Symph](http://sym.ph)? No worries! This guide covers the basics of setting up a developer & designer environment on MacOS (Sierra). 

Most of our backend developers here speak parseltongue, So we're also gonna have to set up [Python](http://www.python.org), & [GoogleApp Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) too.

We will also set up some basic stuff like [Node](http://nodejs.org) (JavaScript), [Git](https://git-scm.com) and your tips to making your terminal look badass with [Oh My Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/), and so much more. We'll also install a few daily-use applications. 

All contributions to the book are welcome. 


*Note: We're looking for contributors to maintain and extend the documentation even more!

**Another Note: This book has been generated using [GitBook](http://www.gitbook.io) and is open source, feel free to contribute or signal issues.
